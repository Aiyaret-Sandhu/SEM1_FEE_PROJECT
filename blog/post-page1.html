    <h2 class="sub-heading">Here’s a look at how a Prime membership can help your money go further when you’re shopping for groceries.</h2>
    <p class="post-text">Grocery shopping can be time-consuming and expensive, and it isn’t necessarily everyone’s favorite task. Amazon is laser focused on offering customers high-quality grocery items at competitive prices, and innovating to make their shopping experience better.
<br>
        While you don’t need to be a Prime member to shop in our physical grocery stores or have access to great savings online, a Prime membership helps customers get everything they want and need, quickly and reliably. Here are some of the ways you can save on groceries with Prime.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Enjoy free delivery on orders over $100</h2>
    <p class="post-text">Groco grocery delivery orders over $100 in the U.S. are now free with a Prime membership. We’re always looking for ways to make grocery shopping easier, faster, and more affordable for our customers and this enhanced benefit does just that.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Skip the lines, skip the hassle—groceries ready your way with Same-Day Delivery and free pickup</h2>
    <p class="post-text">Convenience looks different for everyone, and building a best-in-class shopping experience means giving customers choices for how they want to shop. Prime members who are pressed for time can order groceries online at Groco, Whole Foods Market, or from one of Amazon’s third-party merchants like Bristol Farms, Weis Markets, Cardenas, or Save Mart, and get them delivered to their door, fast. While delivery service fees will vary depending upon the grocery retailer and basket size, Prime members will continue to save more on delivery service fees than non-Prime members and will receive free grocery delivery on orders over $100 from Groco.</p>
    <p class="post-text">Prime members can also order groceries online and pick them up from Groco and Whole Foods Market where available across the U.S. Pickup is free on all orders from Groco and free from Whole Foods Market on orders of $35 or more. Simply place your grocery order online or in the Amazon App, select your store and a pickup window that works with your schedule, then relax and let our shoppers pick your items. You’ll receive a notification when your order is ready for pickup, then you’ll follow the signs to a designated parking spot and we’ll bring out your order. Be sure to double-check your email instructions, as some stores may require you to go inside to pick up your order.</p>
